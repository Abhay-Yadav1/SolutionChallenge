# Project Shield

A web-based platform for detecting and reporting pirated content across the internet.

## Overview

Project Shield helps identify potential intellectual property violations by scanning online content and comparing it against a database of protected works. The system calculates similarity percentages and assists in the takedown process of infringing content.

## Core Features

- Content similarity detection
- Percentage-based match calculation
- IP breach classification
- Automated takedown request generation
- Basic reporting interface

## How It Works

1. Input original content for protection
2. System scans for similar content online
3. Matches are analyzed and given a similarity score
4. Content is classified as potential IP breach based on match percentage

## Current Status

This is the frontend implementation of Project Shield, focusing on the user interface for content detection and reporting features.
